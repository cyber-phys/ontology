# Legal Ontology

completly undocumented -- but maybe you'll find something burried here ? 

Note: We are using Lamda Stack on production/dev server

Setup Python Venv
```
python3 -m venv lambda-stack-with-tensorflow-pytorch --system-site-packages
```

Launch Server
```
source lambda-stack-with-tensorflow-pytorch/bin/activate
pnpm run dev
python server.py

sudo tailscale funnel --https 8443 http://127.0.0.1:8000

# Notes:
Somthing like [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13821v1.pdf) but for chatgpt conversation flow:

**Legal Bert**

unfortunately this model is uncased, I would think cased would be more useful in legal tasks where defined terms are usually cased.

## Building out a knowledge graph
Entity Typing:
- requires the model to predict the fine-grained types of a set of free-form phrases given their context

Relation Extraction:
- the model identifies the specific semantic relationship between two entities within a provided sentence.
