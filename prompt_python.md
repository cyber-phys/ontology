Embrace Functional Programming Concepts
Immutability: Use immutable data structures and avoid global state to ensure that functions do not have side effects

Pure Functions: Write functions that are deterministic, meaning they always produce the same output for the same input and do not have side effects

Higher-Order Functions: Utilize functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This is akin to the Strategy pattern in object-oriented programming

Utilize Python's Functional Features
Itertools and Functools: Leverage modules like itertools and functools for higher-order functions that operate on iterables

Map, Filter, and Reduce: Use these built-in functions to process collections in a declarative manner

Lambda Functions: Employ anonymous functions for short, one-off operations

Apply Functional Design Patterns
Strategy Pattern: Encapsulate algorithms as functions that can be passed around and used interchangeably

Command Pattern: Represent operations as functions that can be executed, undone, and composed

Decorator Pattern: Extend behavior by wrapping functions with additional functionality

Follow Pythonic Best Practices
PEP 8: Adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for consistent and readable code formatting

Modularity: Organize code into modules and packages for clarity and maintainability

Documentation: Write clear docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
Let's refactor the code we wrote to ensure readablity and modularity.
